# Base Code For Cipher Game


This is the base code for the workshop.

It is a small python code file containing the base code you will need to carry out the work in the workshop.

## What You Need To Do

Ahead of the session, please make sure you have this code on your machine. 
Users can run this in their choice of IDE, and this code uses Python 3.
If you can, before the session, have a quick look over the code and consider:

* *what is this code doing?*
* *what are its strengths? what are the drawbacks?*
* *how could this potentially be expanded out?*
* *could it be made neater?*

Do not worry about writing any more code ahead of the session. Keep the base code as it is.
Just take a look over it and think about the points. 

We look forward to seeing you on the workshop!
